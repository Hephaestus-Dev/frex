# FREX - Fabric Render Extension

Extensions to the Fabric rendering API.  These may or may not be proposed and accepted for inclusion in the Fabric API.  

Packaged as a separate mod so that rendering implementations and mods that consume these extensions can
depend on it without directly depending on specific implementation.
